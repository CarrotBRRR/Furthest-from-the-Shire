# Furthest from the Shire
This is a GitHub Pages website that lets you input a city name or geographic coordinates and visualizes:

- Your chosen location ("Home").
- Its exact antipode (the point directly opposite on the globe).
- A circle showing locations that are equally far away from both, representing the furthest you can be from your home.

## Features

- Interactive map using Leaflet.js.
- Geocoding via OpenStreetMap Nominatim API.
- Great-circle calculations to determine antipode and midpoint.
- Deployed for free using GitHub Pages.

## Usage

2. Click **Set Location**.
3. View the results on the interactive map.
